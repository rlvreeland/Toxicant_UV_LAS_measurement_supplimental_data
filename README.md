# Toxicant production in under-ventilated compartment fires assessed by laser absorption spectroscopy

This repository contains experimental concentration measurements of CO, CO_2, HCN, C_2H_2, CH_4, C_6H_6, and C_2H_4 from under-ventilated compartment experiments buring cribs of Medium denisty fiberboard (MDF), wood, and a mixture of wood any nylon.
