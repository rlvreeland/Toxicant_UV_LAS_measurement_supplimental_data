# Toxicant production in under-ventilated compartment fires assessed by laser absorption spectroscopy

This repository contains experimental concentration measurements of CO, CO_2, HCN, C_2H_2, CH_4, C_6H_6, and C_2H_4 from under-ventilated compartment experiments buring cribs of Medium denisty fiberboard (MDF), wood, and a mixture of wood any nylon.

Each Folder contains the concentration measurements for an indvidual test. The concentration measurements that were collected during each test are summarized in Test_Matrix.txt. All text files containting data have two columns: time (seconds) and a species measurement in mole fraction (-).
